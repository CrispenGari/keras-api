### MSE - Mean Squared Error Loss
In statistics, the mean squared error or mean squared deviation of an estimator measures the average of the squares of the errorsâ€”that is, the average squared difference between the estimated values and the actual value. MSE is a risk function, corresponding to the expected value of the squared error loss.
