### Callbacks API
A callback is an object that can perform actions at various stages of training (e.g. at the start or end of an epoch, before or after a single batch, etc).

You can use callbacks to:

Write TensorBoard logs after every batch of training to monitor your metrics
Periodically save your model to disk
Do early stopping
Get a view on internal states and statistics of a model during training
...and more
